###GrooverGUI.
First draft. 

Inspired by dataGUI.

Integrating UI and code functionality create much quicker workflow.

Features fold-able dock-able dataGUI like UI panels with custom selection boxs, sliders, icon buttons, function buttons and more.

Intuitive controls respond to wheel events, keyboard arrow events, can be tied to specific keys, multi mouse button functionality left,middle,right buttons. 

Compact, one of the driving needs that dataGUI could not deliver was a compact design. This attempts a high density UI without a needless and precious screen pixels being waisted on padding,  half filled text descriptions etc.


##This is a work in progress 

This is a first draft uploaded to github and is at the moment not considered complete and bug free. I only put it here because I dont like it sitting on my hard drive.
